# In shell scripting, datatypes don't have any major importance.
# Major dataypes used are string and number
# By default, everything is string in shell scripting
# so we don't need to specify the datatype while declaring variables

# Array is a variable which can store multiple values or list of items.
# it can be declared directly similar to normal varibale.
# But will accessing we use {[index value or all]}

# # program-1
# echo "FRUIT is an array"
# FRUIT=("apple" "banana" "mango")
# echo "Fruits are ${FRUIT[@]}"


# Program-2
# echo "enter any three fruits"
# read fruit1
# read fruit2
# read fruit3
# FRUIT=("$fruit1" "$fruit2" "$fruit3")
# echo "The fruits are ${FRUIT[@]}"

# Here we read the fruit names from user and stored them in array
# And printed that array
